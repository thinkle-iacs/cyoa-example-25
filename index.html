    <h1>Biking Home from Work on My First Day Because So Much Fun</h1>
    <p>
      It is the end of your first day at work and you finally are all ready to
      go home. Now you're changed and on your bike: the question is, do you have
      the energy for an extended ride home? Are you
      <a href="ride_straight_home.html">too tired, so you go straight home</a>
      or do you <a href="take_the_long_way.html">decide to get a workout in?</a>
